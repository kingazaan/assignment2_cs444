(50 points in total) Suppose student Ana is running for a charity and asks her friend to chip in the donation. Suppose each friend donates independently, and the donated value \( T_{i} \) is a random variable with the following probability density:
\[
p\left(T_{i}=t_{i}\right)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
c & t_{i} \in[5,25] \text { dollars } \\
c & t_{i} \in[45,65] \text { dollars } . \\
0 & \text { otherwise }
\end{array}\right.
\]

Let's assume \( T_{i} \) 's are mutually independent and each donation is a continuous random variable given they're using electronic transfer. Ana requested from 150 friends for the donation. Let \( X \) be the total amount in dollar Ana collected from these 150 friends. You need to simplify for this problem.
[4 pts] Which of the following theorems or concepts are referenced in the entire question?
(a) i.i.d.
(b) Weak Law of Large Numbers
(c) Central Limit Theorem

Select all possible options that apply.
[3 pts] What would the value of \( \mathbf{c} \) be?
\[
c=\text { number (3 significant figures) }
\]
[5 pts] Calculate \( \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[T_{i}\right]}{c} \) (your answer should be the same regardless of whatever \( c \) value you found above).
\( \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[T_{i}\right]}{c}= \) number (3 significant figure
[7 pts] Calculate \( \frac{\mathbb{E}\left[T_{i}^{2}\right]}{c} \) (your answer should be the same regardless of whatever \( c \) value you found above).
\[
\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[T_{i}^{2}\right]}{c}=\text { number (3 significant figure }
\]

For the remaining subquestions, assume \( T_{i} \) follows a normal distribution instead with mean of 36 and variance of 217.
[10 pts] What is the probability that \( X \) is more than 5562? Assume \( X \) is a normal distributed random variable. Use the given CDF table to solve.
\[
P(X > 5562)=\text { number (2 signific }
\]
[3 pts each] Which row and column (assuming 1indexed, the title row, title column and empty rows do not count and round up/down in the given CDF table can be used to calculate the probability above? Eg for rounding if you get a \( z \) score of 0.519 you should round up to .52 and if you get .514 you should round down to 0.51 )
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline row & integer &  ?  \\
\hline column & integer &  ?  \\
\hline
\end{array}
[5 pts] What would the variance of \( T_{i}-T_{j} \) be assuming \( i \neq j \) ?
\[
\operatorname{var}\left[T_{i}-T_{j}\right]=\text { number }(3 \text { significa }
\]
[10 pts] What is the probability the absolute difference between two donors' contribution is less than 15 dollars?
\[
P\left(\left|T_{i}-T_{j}\right| < 15\right), i \neq j \quad \text { number (2 }
\]
